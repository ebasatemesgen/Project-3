        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>In this project, one of the major challenges I faced was mapping the 2D screen location to the 3D world in Processing. This task was particularly complex due to the intricacies of 3D rendering and interaction.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I attempted to integrate my scorpion model into a 3D Inverse Kinematics framework to add Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) features to it. However, due to time constraints, this integration was not fully implemented.</p>
